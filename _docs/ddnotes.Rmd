Maybe this will turn into a developer's documentation for DeclareDesign some day.

```{r}
library(DesignLibrary)
```


## A Design object

A design object is a function.

```{r}
class(simple_two_arm_designer)
```

It has some attributes that provide meta-data:

```{r}
attributes(simple_two_arm_designer)
```

```{r}
attr(simple_two_arm_designer, 'description')
```

Get a design's arguments as list with `formals()`:

```{r}
formals(simple_two_arm_designer)
```
