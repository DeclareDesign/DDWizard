<p><strong>Usage data</strong></p>

<p>When you visit our website, we temporarily store so-called usage data on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We use this information to enable you to access our website, to monitor and administer our systems, to improve the design of our website and for statistical and security purposes. These purposes pursued by us also represent the legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR.</p>

<p>The saved information includes:</p>

<p>• the website from which the file was requested<br />
• the name of the file<br />
• the date and time of the query<br />
• the amount of data transferred<br />
• the access status (file transferred, file not found)<br />
• the description of the type of web browser used<br />

<p>We delete the IP address after seven days. No personal user profiles are created.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>“Cookies” are small files that are stored on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after the visit to an online service. To manage your visit to our website, we use so-called “session cookies”, which are deleted after you leave our website and close your browser. In the course of website analysis (see section Web analytics with Matomo) we use “permanent” cookies which remain stored on your end device even after closing the browser.</p>

<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser software; however, you may not be able to use all the functions of the website to their full extent after that.</p>

<p><strong>Web analytics with Matomo</strong></p>

<p>Our website uses the web analytics service Matomo on the basis of Art. 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. Matomo uses so-called “cookies”. They are text files which are stored on your computer and which enable us to analyze the use of the website. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie about the use of the website is stored on our server, which serves to optimize our website. The IP address is anonymized before it is stored. These purposes pursued by us also represent the legitimate interest in the use of data in the sense of the legal basis.</p>

<p>The information about the use of this website generated by the cookie is not passed on to third parties. You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, you may not be able to use all the functions of the website to their full extent after that.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to the storage and evaluation of the data from your visit, you can object by mouse click on this page. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser. As a result, Matomo does not collect any session data. However, if you delete your cookies, this will also result in the opt-out cookie being deleted and possibly having to be reactivated by you.</p>

<p><strong>Contact options</strong></p>

<p>You have the opportunity to contact us by electronic mail or by telephone. The data you provide will only be used to answer your enquiry. Your data will only be passed on to third parties if this is necessary to process your request. The legal basis for the use of your data is Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f of the GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in being in contact with the users of the website and in answering any questions you may have or sending information.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement of data provision</strong></p>

<p>The provision of your personal data is not required by law. However, some of the above data is required in order to use our website and the functions, services and contact options it contains. For example, we need your e-mail address in order to send you news from the WZB. When you enter data, we will inform you if it is necessary for the respective service or function to be provided. These corresponding entry fields are marked as mandatory. If data is required, the non-provision of this data means that the service or function in question cannot be provided. In the case of optional data, non-provision may mean that we cannot provide our services in full.</p>

<p><strong>Duration of data storage</strong></p>

<p>We only store your data for as long as is necessary for the provision of our services and there are no retention periods to prevent deletion.</p>

<p><strong>Use of service providers</strong></p>

<p>We employ service providers to provide services and process your data (so-called commissioned data processing). The service providers process the data exclusively upon instructions of the WZB and are obliged to comply with the applicable data protection regulations. All processors have been carefully selected and are only granted access to your data to the extent and for the period required that is necessary for the provision of the services.</p>

<p><strong>Processing of data in countries outside the European Economic Area</strong></p>

<p>Some of the service providers employed by us are located in the United States or other countries outside the European Economic Area. Companies in these countries are subject to data protection laws that may not protect personal data to the same extent as is the case in the member states of the European Union. The WZB ensures that your personal data is adequately protected by means of contractual regulations or other recognized instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Data protection rights of users of this website</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request information about which of your personal data is being stored with us, and for what purpose. In addition, you can have incorrect data corrected or have data deleted if its storage is inadmissible or no longer necessary. You have the right to restriction of processing as well as the right to data portability. Furthermore, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about the data processing taking place.</p>

<p><strong>Information on your right to object</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. The prerequisite for this is that the data processing takes place on the basis of Art. 6 paragraph 1 letter f of the GDPR (processing for the purposes of legitimate interests).</p>
